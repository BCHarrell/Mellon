In Mellon, getting your passwords is as easy as a click of your mouse.

At the main menu, find the profile you want from the list.  Clicking on the profile will automatically copy your password to the clipboard, and you can be on your way. If you need to copy your username, simply right-click on the profile and it will automatically be copied.

If you want to view your profile information, simply click the [+] to expand the profile.  Your password will initially be blurred out, so click on the eye icon to view it.  Clicking on the password field will also copy the password to the clipboard.
