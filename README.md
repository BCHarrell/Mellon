# The server has been shut down. Please use the MellonLocal.jar for a demonstration.
The local version creates a folder in the same location as the .jar file (e.g. your desktop). It should have nearly all the functionality of the online database version, minus bug reporting. This is for demonstration purposes, I would prefer to hide the user files folder somewhere through an installer if it was to become a production application.
