## Password Manager
Creates and stores secure passwords so users only need to remember one
Capstone project for UMGC Computer Science program

## The server has been shut down. Please use the MellonLocal.jar for a demonstration.
The local version creates a folder in the same location as the .jar file (e.g. your desktop). It should have nearly all the functionality of the online database version, minus bug reporting. This is for demonstration purposes, there are a few things I would change (such as using an installer to hide the files, salting the password which was not in the original product) now that I've learned more.
